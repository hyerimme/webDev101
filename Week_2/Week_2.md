## üìñ This Week

### Let's drill down further this week!
- **Terminal** - some simple commands
- **GitHub** - git and GitHub, sign up, install, tutorial
- **Excercise** for GitHub and Terminal
- **Googling**


## üñ•Ô∏è Terminal

Terminals, also known as command lines or consoles, allow us to accomplish and automate tasks on a computer without the use of a graphical user interface.

### If you have any command you want to know, google it!

## üê± GitHub

### What is GitHub?

### We need to know **Git** first
**Git** is a version control tool (software) to track the changes in the source code.
Git is installed on Linux and MacOS computers by default, but Windows.

### Then what is GitHub
**GitHub** is a distributed version-control platform where users can collaborate on or adopt open source code projects
>For more information, click [here](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started)!!

### Git vs GitHub

<img src="https://andersenlab.org/dry-guide/2022-03-09/img/git_v_github.png" alt="git&github" />

### Let's set up GitHub

Step 0. Install Git (only Window).
> If you want to check whether `git` is installed on your computer or not, type
```git --version``` on your command line. It will show what git version is installed on your computer. 
```
git version 2.30.0.windows.1
```
>If not installed, it won't show you the git version.

Step 1. Create GitHub account
> You can create your GitHub account [here](https://github.com/join).

Step 2. Clone [WebDev101](https://github.com/OfficerChul/webDev101)
<img src="https://github.com/OfficerChul/webDev101/blob/main/Week_2/images/github1.jpg?raw=true" />
```
git clone https://github.com/OfficerChul/webDev101.git
```

Step 3. add, commit, push and pull, and fork

- Add a file to staging environment
```
git add .
```
> `"."` means all subfiles

- Package all files in staging area into a commit
```
git commit -m "<message>"
```
> Put the message for the commit instead of `<message>`

- Push files in commit into git repo so that others now can see your changes.
```
git push
```

- If others made a change on your git repo, you can get the most updated change to your local machine(computer).
```
git pull
```

- Creates a completely independent copy of Git repository

**But**, with VsCode GitHub extension, these commands are not needed.

**If you have a configuration issue when you commit, please refer this [link](https://github.com/OfficerChul/webDev101/blob/main/Week_2/git_configuration.md)**


## üçé Exercise for GitHub and Terminal

1. Create GitHub account
2. Fork this repo to your GitHub
3. Read the instruction in `Week_2\practice` directory and do the assignment
4. Add, commit and push the result to your repo
> Follow the git commit convention when you commit. Click [here](https://gist.github.com/robertpainsi/b632364184e70900af4ab688decf6f53) for the convention

## üîç Googling
Googling is very important skills when you write your own code.
When you encounter various errors and do not know what to do, google it!

Step 0.
<br />Select the error and copy <br />
<img src=".\images\google1.jpg" />


Step 1.
<br />Paste it into google search bar
<img src=".\images\google2.jpg" />

Step 2.
<br /> Click one of the website and read the solution
If the solution is not working, search until you find the solution that is working
